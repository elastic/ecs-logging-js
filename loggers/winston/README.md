# @elastic/ecs-winston-format

[![Build Status](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/buildStatus/icon?job=apm-agent-nodejs%2Fecs-logging-js-mbp%2Fmaster)](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/job/apm-agent-nodejs/job/ecs-logging-js-mbp/job/master/)  [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)

A formatter for the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logger compatible with [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html).<br/>
In combination with [filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) you can send your logs directly to Elasticsearch and leverage [Kibana's Logs UI](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/infrastructure/guide/current/logs-ui-overview.html) to inspect all logs in one single place.

**Please note** that this library is in a **beta** version and backwards-incompatible changes might be introduced in future releases. While we strive to comply to [semver](https://semver.org/), we can not guarantee to avoid breaking changes in minor releases.

## Install
```sh
npm i @elastic/ecs-winston-format
```

## Usage
```js
const winston = require('winston')
const ecsFormat = require('@elastic/ecs-winston-format')

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: ecsFormat(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console()
  ]
})

logger.info('ecs is cool!')
logger.error('ecs is cool!', { hello: 'world' })
```

### Serialization

The log will be serialized automatically by the formatter, you don't need to add the [JSON](https://github.com/winstonjs/logform#json) formatter.

### Timestamp
The timestamp will automatically be generated by the formatter, you don't need to add the [timestamp](https://github.com/winstonjs/logform#timestamp) formatter.

### HTTP logs

The formatter can automatically handle Node.js core request and response objects.
If you pass an object that contains the key `req` or `request`, it will handle that as a Node.js core request object,
while if you pass an object that contains the key `res` or `response`, it will handle that as a Node.js core response object.
```js
const http = require('http')
const winston = require('winston')
const ecsFormat = require('@elastic/ecs-winston-format')

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: ecsFormat(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console()
  ]
})

const server = http.createServer(handler)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Listening')
})

function handler (req, res) {
  logger.info('incoming request', { req, res })
  res.end('ok')
}
```
